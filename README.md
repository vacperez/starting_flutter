1. Download SDK Flutter (Windows) 
https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/windows
1.1 
Extract the zip file and place the contained flutter in the desired installation location for the Flutter SDK (for example, C:\src\flutter) or If you wish to run Flutter commands in the regular Windows console, take these steps to add Flutter to the PATH environment variable:

From the Start search bar, enter ‘env’ and select Edit environment variables for your account.
Under User variables check if there is an entry called Path:
If the entry exists, append the full path to flutter\bin using ; as a separator from existing values.
If the entry doesn’t exist, create a new user variable named Path with the full path to flutter\bin as its value.
Note that you have to close and reopen any existing console windows for these changes to take effect.
